/**
 * build-status.mjs — schedule.yaml + what's actually on disk
 *                    → content/status.json  (what /admin/status renders)
 *
 * The split that keeps the page honest:
 *
 *   HAND-KEPT (schedule.yaml)      the curriculum — clusters, teaching days
 *                                  (code, title, lead, Doc tab), which
 *                                  worksheets are each day's material, and
 *                                  where the upstream source is for days
 *                                  nobody has ported yet. The build cannot
 *                                  know these: an unported day has nothing on
 *                                  disk to find, and teaching order is not a
 *                                  property of any file.
 *
 *   DERIVED (here, every build)    is the worksheet live · does it have a
 *                                  compiled deck or only a hosted PDF · which
 *                                  download files exist. Read off disk, so no
 *                                  one has to remember to tick a box after
 *                                  porting a day — and the table cannot claim
 *                                  something the build didn't produce.
 *
 * Days and their worksheets are listed in schedule.yaml's order, which is
 * teaching order — never sorted here.
 *
 * status.json holds facts, not URLs: cluster ids and slugs, never a base-path-
 * prefixed href (the page applies NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH at render time — see
 * docs/DEVELOPMENT.md on never baking the base path into generated content).
 *
 * Data errors are FATAL, in schedule.mjs (bad roster) and here (a built
 * worksheet no day lists). Each is a one-line fix, and a status page that
 * quietly drops a day is worse than a red build.
 *
 * Usage: build-status.mjs            (also called by build-content.mjs)
