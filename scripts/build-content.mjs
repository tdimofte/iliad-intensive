/**
 * build-content.mjs — turn tex/<slug>/main.tex into everything the site
 * serves. ONLY the tex sources live in git; all outputs are build artifacts:
 *
 *   content/modules/<slug>.mdx           the page body
 *   content/index.json                   homepage/sidebar listing
 *   public/uploads/<slug>/tikz-*.svg     diagrams (content-addressed)
 *   public/downloads/<slug>/…            pdf/tex/mdx, each ± solutions
 *                                        (MDX-authored sheets: mdx only — a
 *                                        reading day is a web page, not a PDF)
 *
 * Where each page sits in the course — its cluster, its teaching day, and the
 * order it is listed in — comes from schedule.yaml (see scripts/schedule.mjs),
 * never from the worksheet itself; the build stamps it into the generated MDX.
 *
 * Worksheets build in parallel (they are fully independent — each writes
 * only its own tex/<slug>/, uploads/<slug>/, downloads/<slug>/ and module
 * file); each worksheet's own steps stay sequential. Logs are buffered per
 * worksheet so parallel output never interleaves.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 something failed (converter warnings, KaTeX errors,
 * or a PDF build failure) — error messages carry file:line from the converter.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   build-content.mjs [flags] [slug ...]   no slugs = build every worksheet
 *
 * Flags:
 *   --check        converter + render gate only (fast; no PDFs/downloads) —
 *                  what the pre-push hook runs
 *   --jobs N       parallel worksheet builds (default: CPU core count)
 *   --no-cache     rebuild every worksheet, ignoring the per-worksheet input
 *                  hash that normally skips unchanged ones
