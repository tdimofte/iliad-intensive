/**
 * The one part of /admin/status that is NOT read off the build: open pull
 * requests, and whether the deployed commit is still the tip of main.
 *
 * Why it can't be a build input. The site is a static export built from main
 * (next.config.ts: output "export"), so at build time it has no knowledge of
 * work sitting on a branch — and baking a snapshot in would mean a PR opened
 * after the last merge stays invisible until the next one. Since in-flight work
 * changes far more often than main does, that snapshot would be wrong most of
 * the time it mattered. So this reads GitHub from the reader's browser instead.
 * The repo is public, so the endpoints need no token and the API answers a
 * cross-origin request (`access-control-allow-origin: *`); the unauthenticated
 * limit is 60/hour per viewer's own IP, and we spend 2 per page load.
 *
 * STRICTLY ADDITIVE. The table is server-rendered from status.json and is
 * complete before any of this runs. JS off, offline, rate-limited, or the repo
 * turned private → every component here renders nothing, every cell keeps the
 * tint the build gave it, and the page is exactly what the build produced.
 * Nothing below is allowed to remove or contradict a fact the build established.
 *
 * The one thing here that touches a build-rendered cell is the tint of the two
 * outstanding columns (InFlightTd, used by Material and Slides), and it splits a
 * build state rather than overriding one: a day with no worksheet — or no deck —
 * is "outstanding", and an open PR says which kind, someone on it or nobody. The
 * glyph and the words ("not ported", "no deck") are the build's and never
 * change, so a cell still can't claim a worksheet or a deck that doesn't exist.
 *
 * The join key is the day code in the PR title — "[D.4] Agent Foundations +
 * [D.5] Decision Theory" claims both days. That convention is already
 * universal in this repo's PRs, and it fails safe: a PR with no code (a CI or
 * docs change) matches no day rather than landing on the wrong row.
