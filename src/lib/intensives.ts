/**
 * intensives/*.yaml — one file per programme ILIAD runs: a place, a set of
 * dates, and a calendar over the curriculum.
 *
 * The split with schedule.yaml is the point. schedule.yaml owns what the
 * material IS — teaching days and which worksheets are a day's material. An
 * intensive owns only WHEN a day is taught, by referencing its code. So a
 * worksheet added to day B.3 appears on every programme that teaches B.3
 * without anyone editing a second file, and no programme can disagree with the
 * curriculum about what B.3 contains.
 *
 * The filename is the URL segment: intensives/aug2026-sf.yaml is served at
 * /intensives/aug2026-sf/. There is no `slug:` key — two sources for one
 * identity is one too many.
 *
 * SERVER-ONLY, like cluster-store.ts, and for the same reason: it reads the
 * filesystem at build time.
 *
 * Unlike cluster-store.ts, malformed data here THROWS rather than falling back
 * to empty. That loader can degrade safely — a listing that loses its day
 * headings still tells the truth. This one cannot: a dropped day or a date off
 * by one is a published schedule that is quietly wrong, and someone plans
 * their week around it. `next build` prerenders these pages, so a throw fails
 * the build, which is the outcome we want.
