# Authoring reference — every supported construct

Construct-by-construct syntax for worksheets, LaTeX first, with the MDX
equivalent where you author `main.mdx` directly. `tex/example/main.tex` is
the living demo of everything here; [iliad-sty.md](iliad-sty.md) covers the
package mechanics.

## Exercises

```latex
\begin{exercise}[Optional Title]
\label{ex:warmup}
\important            % optional ★: one of the sheet's key exercises
Let $p$ be a distribution on a finite set $\mathcal{X}$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Show that $H(p) \geq 0$.  \label{ex:warmup-a}
  \item For which $p$ is $H(p) = 0$?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
```

- Numbered per section ("Exercise 2.1"); the optional argument is the title.
- Label the exercise if a solution or `\cref` points at it; unlabeled
  exercises are allowed but draw a CI warning (no stable web anchor).
- Subparts are a plain `enumerate`; label an `\item` to reference it
  ("Exercise 1.2(a)").
- MDX: `<Exercise id="ex-warmup">**Exercise 1.1.** …</Exercise>`

## Solutions

```latex
\begin{solution}[ex:warmup]
For \cref{ex:warmup-a}: each term is non-negative. \hint{when is $-t\log t = 0$?}
\end{solution}
```

- `[ex:label]` is **mandatory** (compile error without it) — that binding is
  why placement is free: right after the exercise or collected at the end.
- The PDF keeps your placement; **the web always moves each solution directly
  beneath its exercise** (a solutions section left empty by the move is
  dropped from the page — don't `\cref` it from prose).
- Collapsed (`<details>`) on the web; hidden from the PDF by
  `\solutionsfalse`; stripped entirely from the `-nosol` downloads.
- MDX: `<Solution>…</Solution>`

## Solutions-only content

```latex
\begin{solutionsonly}
\textbf{Instructor note.} Discuss \cref{ex:gibbs-hard} on the board first.
\end{solutionsonly}
```

- Content that appears **only** in the with-solutions build — an answer key, an
  instructor aside, a spoiler. Unlike `solution` it has no box, heading, or
  exercise binding, and it is never relocated: it renders as plain content
  exactly where you write it.
- Removed entirely from every `-nosol` download (PDF, `.tex`, `.mdx`), the same
  way solutions are, so those stay spoiler-free. Also hidden from your own PDF
  by `\solutionsfalse` / loading iliad with `[nosolutions]`.
- Prefer this to a bare `\ifsolutions…\fi`: the conditional works in the PDF but
  is **not** honoured on the web (the converter can't evaluate TeX conditionals),
  whereas `solutionsonly` works in both.

## PDF-only content

```latex
\begin{pdfonly}
\begin{solutionsonly}
\clearpage
\appendix
\section{Solutions}
\label{apx:solutions}
\end{solutionsonly}
\end{pdfonly}
```

- Content kept in **both** PDF variants but dropped from the web page and the
  `.mdx` downloads without a trace — nothing inside lands in the page, the
  sidebar, or the anchors.
- The motivating case is a collected back-of-sheet solutions section: on the
  web its solutions relocate under their exercises, so its `\appendix` /
  `\section{Solutions}` header would be left pointing at nothing. Nest
  `solutionsonly` inside `pdfonly` (as above) and the header appears **only**
  in the with-solutions PDF.
- The "don't `\cref` the solutions section" rule is lifted *inside* `pdfonly`:
  a sentence like "\Cref{apx:solutions} provides worked solutions." is fine
  when wrapped this way, since the web never renders it. A `\cref` *outside*
  pointing *in* would be a dead link on the web — the build flags it with a
  warning.
- Numbered material (a `\section`, theorem, exercise) inside `pdfonly` is
  safe for the numbering: the web reads every displayed number out of the
  PDF's own `.aux`, so hiding, say, Theorem 2.4 leaves a faithful gap on the
  web (…2.3, then 2.5), exactly mirroring the PDF. Just remember the hidden
  thing isn't on the page — web-visible `\cref`s to it are dead links (the
  build flags them, see above).

## Hints

```latex
\begin{hint}
Consider $f(t) = t - 1 - \log t$.
\end{hint}
```

- Unnumbered, never labeled, renders exactly where it is written (no
  relocation, unlike solutions).
- PDF: a bold "Hint:" lead-in. Web: a collapsible drop-down, like solutions —
  and unlike solutions, hints survive `\solutionsfalse` and the `-nosol`
  downloads.
- MDX: `<Hint>…</Hint>`

## Learning outcomes and summary

The summary is **metadata, not body text**: it goes in the `%--- iliad ---`
comment block at the top of `main.tex`, as a YAML folded block scalar
(continuation lines indented two spaces after the leading `% `):

```latex
%--- iliad ---
% summary: >-
%   One paragraph on what this sheet is about. It can run over several
%   lines; the line breaks fold into spaces.
%--- end ---
```

Learning outcomes stay in the body:

```latex
\begin{learningoutcomes}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item First outcome.
    \item Second outcome.
  \end{itemize}
\end{learningoutcomes}
```

The body is ordinary LaTeX. For a longer sheet, group the outcomes under
`\subsection*{...}` headings, each with its own `itemize`:

```latex
\begin{learningoutcomes}
  \subsection*{Motivation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item ...
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection*{Core results}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item ...
  \end{itemize}
\end{learningoutcomes}
```

- The summary becomes the page's lede and its index blurb;
  `learningoutcomes` renders as the "What you'll learn" box where you put
  it — after Prerequisites, before the content (see "Front matter opens
  the sheet" below).
- Legacy sheets with a `\begin{summary}` env in the body still convert (it
  is hoisted into the frontmatter), but the metadata block is the home for
  new sheets; a frontmatter `summary:` overrides the env if both are present.
- MDX: put `summary:` in the YAML frontmatter; `<LearningOutcomes>` with a
  markdown list inside. Group headings become bold subheadings in the box
  (not real headings — no anchor, not in the table of contents).
- A summary that is missing, empty, or still `TODO` draws a non-fatal
  **warning** on both paths (LaTeX and MDX) — it is the one metadata field that
  shows up twice, so an unfinished one is worth naming out loud.

## Front matter opens the sheet

Different authors ordered their openings differently; the site does not.
Every sheet opens the same way:

1. **Overview** — not a section: it is the `summary:` in the metadata
   block, and the page header shows it under the title (it doubles as the
   index blurb, so keep it one tight paragraph). A body
   `\section{Overview}` / `## Overview` draws a warning: fold the text
   into `summary:` and drop the section.
2. **Video embeds** (optional) — `\youtube` / `<YouTube />`, see "Videos"
   below.
3. **Prerequisites** — an ordinary section.
4. **Learning outcomes** — the `learningoutcomes` box.

Then the content. Orientation opens a sheet; pointers *out* of it close it
(the mirror rule is "Further reading goes last", just below). The build
checks the opening on both paths (LaTeX and MDX) and prints a non-fatal
**warning** when a sheet strays. Only the opening run is checked — a video
embedded mid-content to illustrate a point is fine and exempt.

## Further reading goes last

A "Further reading" / "Learn more" section is the LAST section of the sheet:
after all taught content, just before the references — or before `\appendix`
if the sheet has one. Prerequisites and the roadmap open a sheet; pointers
*out* of it close it. This holds for every module, LaTeX or MDX.

## Theorem family

```latex
\begin{definition}[entropy]
\label{def:entropy}
The \emph{entropy} of $p$ is …
\end{definition}
```

`definition`, `theorem`, `lemma`, `proposition`, `corollary`, `fact`,
`example` share one per-section counter; `proof` is collapsible on the web.
The optional argument is a name/attribution; on the web every box renders
axiom-style — a bold lead ("**Lemma 2.2 (Gibbs' inequality).**") inside the
coloured box, so names can contain math.
MDX: `<Definition id="def-entropy">**Definition 2.1 (entropy).** …</Definition>`,
`<Theorem id="thm-gibbs">**Lemma 2.2 (Gibbs).** …</Theorem>`.

## Callouts and remarks

```latex
\begin{callout}[warning]
\label{co:pitfall}
Don't confuse $\log$ bases here.
\end{callout}

\begin{remark}[optional title]
An aside in the mathematical register.
\end{remark}
```

- Types: `note` (default), `tip`, `warning` — coloured boxes on web + PDF
  (`[boxes]`).
- `remark` takes an optional title, appended in parentheses:
  `\begin{remark}[Encodings]` renders as "Remark (Encodings)".
- Both may be labelled: no number shows in the box, but
  `\cref{co:pitfall}` prints "Callout 2.1" and links to it.
- MDX: `<Callout type="warning" id="co-pitfall">…</Callout>`

## Math, macros, cross-references

- Inline `$…$`, display `\[…\]`, `equation`, `align` — all KaTeX on the web.
- Your preamble `\newcommand`s / `\DeclareMathOperator`s translate to web
  math macros automatically (avoid `\mathchoice` and optional-argument
  macros — the converter warns at `file.tex:line` when it can't translate).
- `\cref`/`\Cref` resolve to the exact text LaTeX prints, everywhere:
  equations, sections, exercises, subparts, callouts.
- **Reference with `\cref` (or `\eqref` for equation numbers), never by
  hand.** A plain `\ref`, or a `\hyperref` whose visible text hand-writes
  "Appendix A"-style words, draws an **advisory**: the frozen text stops
  tracking the label the moment anything renumbers, and the type word is
  left out of the link. (`\ref*` inside custom `\hyperref` link text is
  fine — the number still comes from the label.)
- A **literal dollar** in prose is `\$` — in a `.tex` sheet and in a
  hand-authored `.mdx` alike (`\$1,000`). It has to be escaped somehow, because
  two bare `$` in one paragraph are a math span to `remark-math`: "wins $1,000
  … and wins $500" typesets everything between them. Inside math the escape
  does not apply (the body is raw, so a `$` byte would end the span) — the
  converter emits `\char36` there, and by hand that is what to write.

## Figures

```latex
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{fig/value-curve.pdf}
  \caption{An example figure.}
  \label{fig:value}
\end{figure}
```

- Export figures to **PDF** into your `fig/` folder — the build converts
  them to SVG for the web. Web-native assets (`.svg`, `.png`, …) in `fig/`
  are served as-is.
- Inline `tikzpicture`/`tikzcd` also works: each diagram is compiled and
  rendered for the web automatically.
- MDX: `<Figure src="/uploads/your-slug/value-curve.svg" caption="…" />`

## Videos

```latex
\youtube{dQw4w9WgXcQ}                          % title auto-queried from YouTube
\youtube[What is a neural network?]{aircAruvnKk}   % title set by hand
```

- The argument is the **11-character video ID** — the `v=` value of the watch
  URL, not the URL itself (a full URL draws a CI warning and a broken embed).
- Web: an embedded player, with a "Watch on YouTube ↗" link beneath it. The
  title is shown above that link and used as the player's accessibility
  title. With no `[Title]`, the build queries the video's real title from
  YouTube (oEmbed, cached in `content/modules/.video-titles.json`); if the
  lookup fails (offline build, deleted video) the embed ships untitled with a
  CI warning. An explicit `[Title]` always wins and needs no network.
- PDF: a **Video:** line carrying the full watch URL — clickable on screen and
  still readable on a printed sheet.
- Block-level: it sets its own paragraph, so write it between paragraphs, not
  mid-sentence.
- MDX: `<YouTube id="aircAruvnKk" title="…" />`
- Lecture recordings are front matter: they open the sheet, before
  Prerequisites (see "Front matter opens the sheet"). A video illustrating
  one point sits wherever that point is — that's fine too.

## Slides

A worksheet folder may carry an optional slide deck:

```
tex/<slug>/slides.tex        # any self-contained LaTeX (usually beamer)
```

- If `slides.tex` is present, the build compiles it to `slides.pdf` and hosts
  it beside the other downloads — the page gains a **Slides** row (view PDF,
  download PDF, download the `.tex`). Same 3× `pdflatex` + `bibtex` ladder as
  the worksheet; a compile error fails the build with `file.tex:line`.
- **Handout variant.** A deck that mentions `\HANDOUT` opts into a second,
  collapsed build. Guard the reveals with it in the preamble:
  ```latex
  \ifdefined\HANDOUT\PassOptionsToClass{handout}{beamer}\fi
  \documentclass[10pt,aspectratio=169]{beamer}
  ```
  The build then also produces `slides-handout.pdf` by `\def`-ing the macro on
  the command line, and the **Slides** row reads *present · handout · LaTeX*
  instead of *view · download · LaTeX*. A deck with no `\pause` reveals simply
  never mentions `\HANDOUT` and builds once. To reproduce either build by hand:
  ```
  pdflatex slides.tex                                  # presentation
  pdflatex -jobname=slides-handout "\def\HANDOUT{}\input{slides}"   # handout
  ```
- `iliad.sty` is a *worksheet* contract and is **not** loaded for slides —
  style the deck however you like.
- **An optional shared style.** `tex/iliad-slides.sty` is a beamer preamble you
  may load instead of writing your own: the Madrid theme, the usual maths and
  graphics packages, link colours that stay readable on Madrid's dark bars, and
  `\citev` for citations. Load it after `\documentclass`, local copy first:
  ```latex
  \ifdefined\HANDOUT\PassOptionsToClass{handout}{beamer}\fi
  \documentclass[10pt,aspectratio=169]{beamer}
  \IfFileExists{iliad-slides.sty}{\usepackage{iliad-slides}}{\usepackage{../iliad-slides}}
  ```
  The `\HANDOUT` line and `\documentclass` stay in your deck — the first has to
  run before the class is loaded, and the second keeps the font size and aspect
  ratio yours. Nothing enforces this: it is a starting point rather than a
  contract, no build step checks for it, and `tex/training-dynamics/slides.tex`
  uses the moloch theme with its own preamble instead. The example, AIXI and
  Solomonoff decks load it.
- Slides are **never** converted to MDX and have **no** `-nosol` variant (a
  deck is a download, not a web page).
- No source, only a PDF deck? Don't commit the binary. Host it (e.g. Drive)
  and point at it from the `%--- iliad ---` block:
  ```
  %--- iliad ---
  % slides: https://drive.google.com/…
  %--- end ---
  ```
  It renders as an outbound **Slides ↗** link. A compiled `slides.tex` takes
  precedence over the URL.
- The build emits a non-fatal **warning** for any worksheet with no
  `slides.tex` (whether or not a `slides:` URL is set), in the full build and
  `./run.sh ci` — not in the `--check` watch/pre-push loop.
- For a day with **no worksheet yet**, there is no frontmatter to hold a
  `slides:` URL — put it on the day itself in [`schedule.yaml`](../schedule.yaml)
  instead. Deck precedence, highest first: a compiled `slides.tex` → a
  worksheet's `slides:` URL → the day's `slides:` URL → no deck.

## Which teaching day is this? (not your file's business)

Your frontmatter describes the *worksheet*. Where it sits in the *course* —
its cluster, its teaching day, the order it's listed in — lives in one central
file, [`schedule.yaml`](../schedule.yaml), which lists each day's worksheets in
reading order:

```yaml
      - code: D.3
        title: AIXI
        worksheets:
          - solomonoff-induction    # order here is the order on the site
          - aixi
```

- Add your slug under its day and you're done: the homepage, the sidebar and
  [`/admin/status`](https://iliad-team.github.io/iliad-intensive/admin/status/)
  all follow, and the build stamps `cluster:`/`day:` into your page for you.
- Several worksheets per day is normal — D.3 is Solomonoff Induction then AIXI,
  and that order is a fact about teaching, which no sort of the titles could
  have recovered.
- Writing `cluster:` or `day:` in your own frontmatter **fails the build**: two
  places to state one fact is one too many.
- A worksheet no day lists also **fails the build**, so nothing can quietly
  land unplaced. (`unlisted: true` opts a sheet out of the course entirely —
  that's the format demo, and almost certainly not you.)

## Citations

Entries go in your folder's `biblo.bib`; `\cite{Shannon:48}` etc. as normal
(`\bibliography{biblo}` + a style at the end of the sheet). On the web,
citations render as author-year text linking to an anchored entry in a
References list at the bottom of the page; there, an entry with a `url`
(or arXiv `eprint`) field makes its title the outbound link. Citations
never link straight out of the page.

**Pick whatever style you like.** `\bibliographystyle` governs the PDF only —
the converter never reads it. It parses `biblo.bib` itself and normalizes
every citation to the same author-year form on the web, so an alpha-label
sheet (`alphaurl` → `[Knu73]`) and a natbib author-year one (`plainnat` →
`(Fishburn, 1971)`) read identically online and differ only in their PDFs.
natbib's commands are all understood: `\citet` keeps its grammatical form
("Watanabe 2009 defines…"), while `\cite`, `\citep`, `\citealp` and
`\citetext` render parenthesized.

A style bibtex cannot open produces no `.bbl`, and pdflatex then degrades every
`\cite` to `[?]` without erroring — so the build treats any bibtex failure
other than "this document has no bibliography" as fatal.

`alphaurl` needs no package: it is vendored at `tex/alphaurl.bst` (verbatim from
urlbst 0.9.1) and found through `BSTINPUTS`, because the Debian package carrying
it is 75 MB for one 36 KB file. For a style that is neither vendored nor in base
TeX Live, prefer **vendoring the `.bst`** over adding an apt package — the CI TeX
download is the build's biggest cost and a slow mirror can stall it for 15+
minutes. A per-worksheet `.bst` works too
(`tex/singular-learning-theory/far.bst` does exactly that).

## Inline marks

- `\hint{…}` → *[Hint: …]* — `\note{…}` → *[Note: …]*
- `\important` after an exercise's label → ★ (the sheet's key exercises)

## Footnotes

`\footnote{…}` becomes a real footnote on the web, not a parenthetical: a
numbered marker where you wrote it, the note itself at the foot of the page, and
a link each way. Nothing about the PDF changes.

`\footnotemark` … `\footnotetext{…}` works too — the split form LaTeX needs when
the marker sits somewhere that cannot carry the text, such as a theorem's title
argument (`\begin{definition}[Covering\protect\footnotemark]`). The mark takes
the next number and the next `\footnotetext` fills it in, so keep them in that
order; a `\footnotetext` with no mark before it stays inline in parentheses and
draws a warning.

Notes are numbered per page in source order, and the numbering is the renderer's
— it counts references, so it stays right no matter where the definitions sit.
One caveat: a footnote spanning several paragraphs is joined into one on the
page (a blank line would end the note), and the build says so.

Footnotes inside a `solution` are stripped from the `-nosol` download along with
the answer — the note included, not just its marker.

## Writing in MDX instead

`main.mdx` replaces `main.tex` entirely: YAML frontmatter (`title`,
`summary`, `contributors` — `title` required, there's no
`\title{}` to fall back on), KaTeX math with `$…$`/`$$…$$`, and the JSX
components named above. **There is no PDF**: LaTeX is the format that becomes a
print artifact, MDX the one that becomes a web page, so an MDX-authored sheet is
a page and nothing else. Downloads offer Markdown alone (± solutions) — no PDF,
no LaTeX. Everything else — the `-nosol` variant, the index, the render gate —
works identically.

A hand-authored `main.mdx` is **copied verbatim** into
`content/modules/<slug>.mdx` — no converter, no preprocessing — and served as
the page. Nothing else consumes it, and the rules below follow from that: the
page is the whole output.

### Teaching notes: `<TeachingNote>` (MDX only)

A reading day's source often carries material addressed to whoever *teaches*
the day rather than to the student reading the page — what a session is for,
and how the author ran it last time. That goes in a `TeachingNote`:

```mdx
<TeachingNote title="Session intent">

The participants understand that there are different things we may want our
AIs to be aligned *to*, and can reason through …

</TeachingNote>

<TeachingNote title="Teaching notes">   {/* the default title is "Teaching note" */}

I was thinking about including Gwern's article on Tool AI's, but it's very
verbose, so I opted for Rohin's article instead.

</TeachingNote>
```

- Collapsed by default, so it doesn't sit in the student's reading flow; the
  `title` is the label on the closed box.
- Blank lines around the body, like every component with markdown inside.
- The label belongs in `title`, not in the body: port
  `**Session intent:** The participants …` as
  `<TeachingNote title="Session intent">The participants …`.
- Not a `Callout`: teacher-facing material carries
  `data-component="teaching-note"` so it stays findable (a strip, an index, a
  toggle) once we know what the right format is. It survives `-nosol` — only
  `<Solution>` is stripped.
- **In LaTeX it is the `teachingnote` environment**, whose optional argument is
  the title: `\begin{teachingnote}[Session intent] … \end{teachingnote}`. The
  converter emits this component from it. A PDF has no collapsing, so there it
  is a dashed box with the title as its heading.

### Heading levels: `##` is the top

Match what the converter emits for a LaTeX day, so a hand-written page and a
generated one have the same shape:

| LaTeX | MDX |
| :--- | :--- |
| `\section` | `##` |
| `\subsection` | `###` |
| `\subsubsection` | `####` |

**Never `#`.** The site renders the frontmatter `title` as the page's h1, so a
`#` in the body is a second h1 sitting a level above every generated page's
sections. Numbered sections in generated pages carry an `N.` prefix read from
the `.aux` (`## 1. Preliminaries`); hand-authored days aren't numbered, so
don't add numbers by hand. Don't mix a bold line (`**Session 2: …**`) with a
real `### Session 1: …` for the same level — pick the heading.

### Comments: `{/* … */}`

```mdx
{/* # Roadmap for today */}
{/* parked until the author confirms the timetable */}
```

That is the only form MDX accepts. One per line is fine, so is a blank line
inside a single `{/* … */}` block. `<!-- … -->` is a **compile error**, not a
comment:

    MDX compile: FAIL :: Unexpected character `!` (U+0021) before name …
      (note: to create a comment in MDX, use `{/* text */}`)

A comment hides from the rendered page, but the `<slug>.mdx` download is the file
itself, so parked content still travels with it. Use `{/* … */}` freely while
drafting and delete it before you ship rather than leaving it commented — git
history is the place for a block you might want back.

### GFM: footnotes and tables

The page pipeline loads `remark-gfm`, so GitHub-flavoured markdown works in a
hand-authored sheet as well as in a converted one — footnotes and tables being
the two that matter:

```mdx
The claim holds for finite horizons.[^horizon]

[^horizon]: It fails for $m = \infty$; see the appendix.
```

Any label does (`[^horizon]`, `[^1]`); the renderer numbers notes by the order
their references appear, and collects them at the foot of the page. A reference
with no definition renders as the literal text `[^horizon]` — that is the one
failure mode to watch for, and the sheet still compiles.

### Frontmatter

Never write `cluster:` or `day:` — those belong to `schedule.yaml` and the
build stamps them in. Writing either is a hard build failure:

    main.mdx frontmatter sets `day` — that lives in schedule.yaml (list the
    slug under its day) and is stamped in at build time

So a new MDX module is two edits: the file, plus its slug under the right day's
`worksheets:` in `schedule.yaml`.

### Check it

    node scripts/tex2mdx/tex2mdx-check.mjs tex/<slug>/main.mdx   # the render gate alone, ~1s
    node scripts/build-content.mjs --check <slug>                # + the frontmatter/schedule rules
    node scripts/build-content.mjs <slug>                        # + staged downloads

The gate wants `MDX compile: OK` and `0 errored` KaTeX spans. Only `--check`
catches a `cluster:`/`day:` in frontmatter or a slug missing from
`schedule.yaml` — and for an MDX sheet `--check` is essentially the whole story,
since the full build adds only the copied `.mdx` downloads, with no PDF ladder
to go wrong.
